    <h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode; color: #B8B8B8; text-align:center "> I'm currently a senior at Tesla STEM High School in Redmond, Washington. I was born and raised in the greater <br> Seattle area.
    I am a portrait photographer and have been fascinated by photography ever since I was younger. <br> It took me up until Junior year to
    finally practice it myself. </h3>

    <h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;color: #B8B8B8; text-align:center"> I enjoy photography, tennis, and napping! <br> A little fun fact about me is that I've slept through an entire fire alarm! </h5>

  <h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;color: #B8B8B8; text-align:center"> Accessiblity </h3>
  <h5 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;color: #B8B8B8; text-align:center"> I try to make my website more accessible by creating <br> a contrast between the background and the text <br>
    in a way that makes the text pop out. I also have big text so it's easier to read. <br>
    <br>
    What I really enjoy about other websites is the gentle look <br> they have with a pastel color scheme. <br>
    I'm most proud of learning how to format the text and the background in <br>
    a more aesthetically pleasing way. </h5>
