  <h5 style="font-family:Source Sans Pro;"> I'm currently a senior at Tesla STEM High School in Redmond, Washington. I was born and raised in the greater <br> Seattle area. 
    I am a portrait photographer and have been fascinated by photography ever since I was younger. <br> It took me up until Junior year to 
    finally explore this topic. </h5>
