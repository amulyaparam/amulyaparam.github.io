    <h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode; color: #B8B8B8; text-align:center "> I'm currently a senior at Tesla STEM High School in Redmond, Washington. I was born and raised in the greater <br> Seattle area.
    I am a portrait photographer and have been fascinated by photography ever since I was younger. <br> It took me up until Junior year to
    finally explore this topic. </h3>
